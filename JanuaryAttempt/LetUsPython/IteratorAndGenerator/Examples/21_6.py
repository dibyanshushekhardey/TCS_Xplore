'''
Write a program to multiply two matrices x(2 x 3) and y(2, 2) using list
comprehension.
'''

x=[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
y=[[11, 12], [21, 22], [31, 32]]
l1=[xrow for xrow in x]
print(l1)
l2=[(xrow, ycol) for ycol in zip(*y) for xrow in x]
print(l2)
l3=[[sum(a*b for a, b in zip(xrow, ycol)) for ycol in zip(*y)] for xrow in x]
print(l3)
